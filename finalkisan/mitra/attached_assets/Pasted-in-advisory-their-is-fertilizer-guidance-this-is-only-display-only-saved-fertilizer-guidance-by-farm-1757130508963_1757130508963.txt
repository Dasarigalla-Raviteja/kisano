Design a “Sell Produce” page for a farmer-focused mobile app.

This page opens when the user clicks Sell Crops inside the Marketplace section of the Home page.

Top Section

A single horizontal bar with three elements:

Tab: “Active” (default selected).

Tab: “Sold”.

On the right side → a label showing total earnings, e.g., “Earned: ₹12,500”.

Only one tab can be selected at a time.

Active tab → shows ongoing listings.

Sold tab → shows completed listings with earnings.

Listings Section

Show listings as cards with clear details:

Example (Active): “🥔 Potato – 100 kg – ₹12/kg – Transport: Yes”.

Example (Sold): “🍅 Tomato – 80 kg – ₹25/kg – Transport: Yes – Earned: ₹2,000”.

Use a clean layout, large fonts, minimal text, and crop emojis/icons for easy readability.

Floating Action Button (FAB)

A green circular “+” button fixed at the bottom-right corner.

When tapped → open a Create New Listing form as a modal or slide-up panel.

Create New Listing Form

Keep it online, simple, and fast:

Crop Name → dropdown or auto-filled when selecting from market list.

Quantity (kg) → numeric input.

Price per kg → auto-filled with live market price (editable).

Toggle switch → “Need Transport? Yes / No”.

Submit button → large green button.

Market Prices Section (Optional, below listings)

Title: “Select Crop to Sell”.

Show a scrollable horizontal list or grid of crop cards.

Each card displays crop name + average price, e.g.:
